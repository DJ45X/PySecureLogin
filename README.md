# Welcome to my Secure Login Project!
___

This Python project showcases my proficiency in password encryption and secure database storage techniques using salting and hashing methods with bcrypt. Designed as a command-line application rather than a full-fledged website, the project prioritizes a focused exploration of password security principles. By implementing bcrypt for hashing passwords and incorporating salting to mitigate common vulnerabilities, this project underscores the importance of robust password management practices in safeguarding user credentials.

Future additions may include password peppering to further demonstrate more complex password encryption methods.

**Technologies used include:**
- Python
- Bcrypt
- SQL (MariaDB was used in my environment)
