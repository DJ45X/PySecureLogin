# Welcome to my Secure Login Project! [Work in Progress]
___

This python project will demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of password encryption and secure database storing using salting and hashing methods through bcrypt. This application is purposely designed to run in command line instead of having a fully built website created so as to enhance focus on the primary objective of password encryption and securely storing in a database.

**Technologies used include:**
- Python
- Bcrypt
- MySQL
- Docker

This project is open freely to all to try out, improve, or use.
